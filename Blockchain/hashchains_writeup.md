Scenario:

*You've registered for an online service that uses hash chains.
You've registered as user 'n00B' and have been given the hash chain seed 654e1c2ac6312d8c6441282f155c8ce9
Use the given information to figure out how to authenticate as the user 'ESCS' for the given challenge hash c89aa2ffb9edcc6604005196b5f0e0e4
i.e. Find the hash that hashes to this - This hash will be your solution*

Solution:

We'll use the python library hashlib to calculate the MD5 hash.
First, we need to know the seed of the hashing algorithm. We can get the seed with a web search of the given MD5 hash for the 
seed generated for the user 'nOOB'. With the [reverse check of the MD5](https://md5.gromweb.com/?md5=654e1c2ac6312d8c6441282f155c8ce9)
we get that the seed is 'Noob'. The seed generation consists then in replacing lower case letters with upper case letters, 
and vice versa.

With that known, we can implement our own algorithm to generate the seed of a given username (`calculate_seed()`).
Next, we need to know the number of times the seed is being hased. As we now know the seed, and we already knew the challenge
hash, we can now get the number of times it's being hashed. To do so, I used the function `get_hashes(seed, iterations)` inside a loop until the calculated hash is the same as the given one. It turned out that it calculated the hash 1100 times.

With all this information we can easily get the required target hash. It will be the hash number 1099, or the penultimate hash when calculating all the 1100 iterations.

To simplify the process, I created a function that calculates the seed and then calls the function to hash that seed 1100 times. 

The result target hash is:
