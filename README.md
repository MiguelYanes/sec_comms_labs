Secure Communication Labs
=========================

Labs for the Secure Communications and Cryptography module at TU Dublin.

All the labs have been implemented using python3 in a Linux machine. However, you may be able to execute some of them 
in a windows machine (Blockchain, Crecit Card Validator) or with python 2.7 (RSA).

The write-up of every lab is included in a markdown file with the source code of each solution.
