RSA Level 10
============

For level 10, we get again the values of n, e and c for two different communications. Unlike level 9, in this case is 
quite simple to get the repeated message.

After a few checks, it turned out that c2 is quite a small message, so m^e2 < n2; and as e2 is 3, we just need to do the 
cubic root of c2 to get the message:
