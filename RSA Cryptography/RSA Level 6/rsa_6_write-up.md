RSA Level 6
===========

We get some RSA values (e, p, q) and we need to get d to decrypt the ciphertext.

To get the decription key, we need to apply the Euclidean algorithm to get the modular 
inverse of d, knowing the value of phi ((p-1) * (q-1)) and n. With this algorithm we 
can get the value of d, an with ciphertext and n we decrypt the message:
